Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 34, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher Android SDK version:
- file_selector_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- path_provider_android compiles against Android SDK 36
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to D:\dev\github\Aurora\android\app\build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        compileSdk = 36
        ...
    }
